Know more about KnowFood!

KnowFood is an application that combines an analysis of Princeton's Dining Hall foods with Amazon Echo's Alexa to provide users information about nutrients and what to eat. The software part of our project involves reading in information about foods in dining halls around Princeton from dining.princeton.edu and determining which foods will satisfy daily nutrient requirements. These nutrient requirements are estimated from the user's age, height, weight, gender, and diet restrictions. To spice up our project, we combined this analysis with Amazon Echo's Alexa. When Alexa is prompted with a question about a meal at a certain dining hall, she responds with the ideal meal to fulfill all your bodily needs. Thus, our project utilizes technology to promote health while decreasing food waste for the environment.
